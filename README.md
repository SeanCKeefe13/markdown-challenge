# markdownChallenge

This challenge from Bob Zirolli's Scrimba React course is designed to give the developer a pre built application that needs some basic functionality added to it.
Functionalities added: Delete note, create unqiue title for each specific note by extracting the first designated heading line in the markdown document, push the most recent updated note to the top of list, and sync up localStorage capability to allow the user to maintain their notes.
